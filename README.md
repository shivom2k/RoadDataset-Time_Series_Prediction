# TimeSeries-Evaluation

Decision tree regression observes features of an object and trains a model in the structure of a tree to predict data in the future to produce meaningful continuous output. Scikit-learn API provides the DecisionTreeRegressor class to apply decision tree method for regression task. 
in this assignment we fit and predict regression data by using the DecisionTreeRegressor class in Python.
